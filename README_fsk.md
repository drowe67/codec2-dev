# README_fsk

A FSK modem with a non-coherent demodulator.  Performance is within a fraction of a dB of ideal.  The demodulator automagically estimates the tone frequencies and tracks frequency drift.

Here is a typical Bit Error Rate (BER) versus Eb/No curve:

![BER versus Eb/No curve](doc/fsk_modem_ber_8000_100.png)

Note how close the theory line is to measured performance.

This modem can demodulate FSK signals that sound like [this sample](doc/lockdown_3s.wav); and is used to receive images from the [edge of space](https://github.com/projecthorus/wenet):

## Credits

The Octave version of the modem was developed by David Rowe.  Brady O'Brien ported the modem to C, and wrote the C/Octave tests.  The modem is being maintained by David Rowe.  Mark Jessop has helped improve the modem operation by testing against various balloon telemtry waveforms.

## Quickstart

1. Build codec2:
   ```
   $ cd codec2 && mkdir build_linux && cmake .. && make
   ```

1. Generate 1000 test bits, modulate them using 2FSK using a 8000 Hz sample rate, 100 bits/s, play on your sound card:
   ```    
   $ cd ~/codec2/build_linux/src
   $ /fsk_get_test_bits - 1000 | ./fsk_mod 2 8000 100 1200 1200 - - | aplay -f S16_LE
   ```
    The low tone frequency is 1200Hz, and the upper tone 1200 + 1200 = 2400Hz.

1. Add the demodulator and measure the bit error rate over 10,000 bits of 100 bit/s 2FSK:
   ```
   $ ./fsk_get_test_bits - 10000 | ./fsk_mod 2 8000 100 1200 100 - - | ./fsk_demod -l 2 8000 100 - - | ./fsk_put_test_bits -
   <snip>
   [0099] BER 0.000, bits tested   9900, bit errors    0
   PASS
   ```
   We get a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 0, as there is no channel noise to induce bit errors.
   
1. Same thing but this time with 4FSK, and less verbose output:
   ```
   $ ./fsk_get_test_bits - 10000 | ./fsk_mod 4 8000 100 1200 100 - - | ./fsk_demod -l 4 8000 100 - - | ./fsk_put_test_bits -q -
   <snip>
   [0099] BER 0.000, bits tested   9900, bit errors    0
   PASS
   ```

1. Lets add some channel noise:
   ```
   $ ./fsk_get_test_bits - 10000 | ./fsk_mod 2 8000 100 1200 100 - - | ./cohpsk_ch - - -26 --Fs 8000 | ./fsk_demod -l 2 8000 100 - - | ./fsk_put_test_bits -b 0.015 -
   <snip>
   SNR3k(dB): -5.76 C/No: 29.0 PAPR:  3.0 
   [0099] BER 0.010, bits tested   9900, bit errors  103
   PASS
   ```
   The cohpsk_ch utility takes the FSK modulator signal, and adds calibrated noise to it (the -26 value specifies the noise).  Try changing the noise level, and note how the Bit Error Rate (BER) changes.  The BER is 0.01, which is right on theory for this sort of FSK demodulator at this SNR (2FSK non-coherent demodulator Eb/No=9dB).  

   The SNR is calculated using the signal power divided by the noise power in 3000 Hz.  The C/No value is the same thing, but uses a noise bandwidth of 1 Hz.  There is less noise power when you look at just 1Hz, so C/No is higher. Peak to Average Power ratio (PAPR) is 3dB as a FSK signal is just a single sine wave, and a sine wave peak is 3dB higher than it's average.

1. You can visualise the C modem operation with a companion python script, for example:
   ```
   ./fsk_get_test_bits - 10000 | ./fsk_mod -p 10 4 8000 400 400 400 - - | ./fsk_demod -p 10 -t1 4 8000 400 - /dev/null 2>stats.txt
   python ../../octave/plot_fsk_demod_stats.py stats.txt
   ```

1. Send some digital voice using FSK at 800 bits/s, the try the two 2400 bits/s FSK modes:
   ```
   ./freedv_tx 800XA ../../raw/ve9qrp.raw - | ./freedv_rx 800XA - - -vv | aplay -f S16_LE
   ./freedv_tx 2400A ../../raw/ve9qrp.raw - | ./freedv_rx 2400A - - -vv | aplay -f S16_LE
   ./freedv_tx 2400B ../../raw/ve9qrp.raw - | ./freedv_rx 2400B - - -vv | aplay -f S16_LE
   ```
   
1. FSK modem C files in ```codec2/src```:

   | File | Description |
   | ---  | --- |
   | fsk.c/fsk.h | Core FSK modem library |
   | fsk_mod.c | command line modulator |
   | fsk_demod.c | command line demodulator |
   | fsk_get_test_bits.c | source of test bits |
   | fsk_put_test_bits.c | test bit sync, counts bit errors and packet errors |
   | fsk_mod_ext_vco.c | modulator that uses an external FSK oscillator |

1. GNU Octave files in ```codec2/octave```:

   | File | Description |
   | ---  | --- |
   | fsk_lib.m | Core FSK modem library |
   | fsk_lib_demo.m | A demonstration of fsk_lib, runs a single point BER test |
   | fsk_demod_file.m | Demodulates FSK signals from a file, useful for debugging FSK waveforms |
   | fsk_lock_down.m | simulations to support the "lock down" waveform |
   | tfsk.m | automated test that compares the C and Octave versions of the modem |
   
   You can run many of them from the Octave command line:
   ```
   $ octave --no-gui
   octave:1> fsk_lib_demo
   ```

1. A suite of automated ctests that exercise the C and Octave code:
   ```
   $ cd ~/codec2/build_linux
   $ ctest -R test_fsk
   1/9 Test #39: test_fsk_lib ......................   Passed    3.37 sec
   3/9 Test #41: test_fsk_modem_octave_port ........   Passed    4.17 sec
   4/9 Test #42: test_fsk_modem_mod_demod ..........   Passed    0.06 sec
   5/9 Test #43: test_fsk_2fsk_ber .................   Passed    0.24 sec
   6/9 Test #44: test_fsk_4fsk_ber .................   Passed    0.12 sec
   7/9 Test #45: test_fsk_4fsk_ber_negative_freq ...   Passed    0.07 sec
   8/9 Test #46: test_fsk_4fsk_lockdown ............   Passed    2.84 sec
   9/9 Test #47: test_fsk_vhf_framer ...............   Passed    0.06 sec
   ```
   These are written in ```codec2/CmakeLists.txt```, inspect them to find out how we test the modem.

1. The Octave version is useful for peering inside the modem, for example when debugging.  Here is an example of debugging a Wenet sample:
   ```
   $ octave --no-gui
   octave:1> fsk_horus_as_a_lib=1; fsk_horus; demod_file("../raw/wenet_sample.c8",test_frame_mode=9, 0, 100, max_frames=50);
   ```
   Running this pops up a bunch of plots. Here is the 3D plot the modem spectrum evolving over time, using a 128 point FFT:
   ![Wenet spectrum 3D](doc/wenet_spectrum_3d.png)

   This is a 2FSK signal so we should see two tones.  However there are three tones. The lowest one is a "DC line" common in signals from RTL-SDRs or those with coarse quantisation.  This DC tone was confusing the "peak" frequency estimator.

   To work around this problem we can tell the C version of the modem to ignore low frequency tones with the ```fsk_lower``` option:
   ```
   $ cd ~/codec2/build_linux/src
   $ cat /home/david/codec2/raw/wenet_sample.c8 | ./fsk_demod --cu8 --fsk_lower 500 -s 2 8000 1000 - - | ./drs232_ldpc - /dev/null
   packets: 17 packet_errors: 0 PER: 0.000
   ```
   This successfully decodes all 17 packets in the sample with no errors, yayyy!
