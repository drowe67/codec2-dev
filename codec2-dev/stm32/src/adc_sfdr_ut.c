  Unit test for high speed ADC SFDR testing.  Samples ADC1 from in PA1 at 
  Fs=2 MHz and write raw samples to a file, in discontinuus blocks of 
  ADC_TUNER_BUF_SZ/2 samples.  The blocks are discontinuous as we 
  don'thave the bandwitdh back to the host to support continuous sampling.

  To process the blocks, fread() ADC_TUNER_BUF_SZ/2 samples at a time,
  abs(fft) and sum results from next block.
