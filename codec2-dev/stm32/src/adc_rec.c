  Records a 16 kHz sample rate raw file from one of the ADC channels.
  Note the semi-hosting system isn't fast enough to transfer 2 16 kHz
  streams at once.
  
  ~/stlink$ sudo ./st-util -f ~/codec2-dev/stm32/adc_rec.elf
  ~/codec2-dev/stm32$ ~/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q1/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb adc_rec.elf
  
  (when finished) 
  $ play -r 16000 -s -2 ~/stlink/adc.raw

  adc1 -> "from radio"  
  adc2 -> "mic amp"
