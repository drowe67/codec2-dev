Codec 2 README
--------------

Codec 2 is an open source (LGPL licensed) speech codec for 2400 bit/s
and below.  For more information please see:

    http://rowetel.com/codec2.html

Also included is a FDMDV modem (README_fdmdv.txt), and an API for
embedding FreeDV in other programs (see example below).  For more
information on building Codec 2 see READE.cmake

Quickstart
----------

NOTE: Use the "codec2" or "codec2-dev" depending on which repository
      you are working with

NOTE: You may not have the necessary speex libraries installed. Some
      distributions may have packages available 
      i.e. sudo apt-get install speex-*
      alternatively, visit http://www.speex.org and follow the instructions

1/ Listen to Codec 2:

   $ cd codec2
   $ mkdir build_linux
   $ cd build_linux
   $ cmake ..
   $ make
   $ ./src/c2demo ../raw/hts1a.raw hts1a_c2.raw
   $ play -t raw -r 8000 -e signed-integer -b 16 ../raw/hts1a.raw
   $ play -t raw -r 8000 -e signed-integer -b 16 ./hts1a_c2.raw

2/ Compress, Decompress and then play a file:

   using 2400 bps bit rate encoding

   $ ./src/c2enc 2400 ../raw/hts1a.raw hts1a_c2.bit
   $ ./src/c2dec 2400 hts1a_c2.bit hts1a_c2_2400.raw 

   which can be played with

   $ play -t raw -r 8000 -e signed-integer -b 16 ./hts1a_c2_2400.raw

   using 450 bps bit rate encoding

   $ ./src/c2enc 450 ../raw/hts1a.raw hts1a_c2.bit
   $ ./src/c2dec 450 hts1a_c2.bit hts1a_c2_450.raw

   which can be played with

   $ play -t raw -r 8000 -e signed-integer -b 16 ./hts1a_c2_450.raw

3/ Same thing with pipes:

   $ ./src/c2enc 1400 ../raw/hts1a.raw - | ./src/c2dec 1400 - - | play -t raw -r 8000 -s -2 -

Embedded FreeDV API
-------------------

See freedv_api.h and freedv_api.c, and the demo programs freedv_tx &
freedv_rx.  Quickstart:

  $ ./freedv_tx ../../raw/hts1.raw - | ./freedv_rx - - | play -t raw -r 8000 -s -2 -q -

Or with a simulated 2 dB SNR channel:

  $ ./freedv_tx ../../raw/hts1.raw - | ./fdmdv_channel - - 2 | ./freedv_rx - - | play -t raw -r 8000 -s -2 -q -

To log the demod state information and received text msg characters to a text file:

  $ ./freedv_tx ../../raw/hts1.raw - | ./fdmdv_channel - - 2 | ./freedv_rx - - log.txt | play -t raw -r 8000 -s -2 -q -
  $ cat log.txt

Programs
--------
 
1/ c2demo encodes a file of speech samples, then decodes them and
saves the result.

2/ c2enc encodes a file of speech samples to a compressed file of
encoded bits.

3/ c2dec decodes a compressed file of bits to a file of speech
samples.

4/ c2sim is a simulation/development version of Codec 2.  It allows
selective use of the various Codec 2 algorithms.  For example
switching phase modelling or LSP quantisation on and off.

Debugging
---------

1/ To compile with debug symbols for using gdb:

  $ cd ~/codec2
  $ rm -Rf build_linux && mkdir build_linux
  $ cd build_linux
  $ CFLAGS=-g cmake ..
  $ make

2/ For dump file support:

  $ cd ~/codec2
  $ rm -Rf build_linux && mkdir build_linux
  $ cd build_linux
  $ CFLAGS=-DDUMP cmake ..
  $ make
